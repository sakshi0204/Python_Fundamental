Brute force code:
def findSecondLargest(sequenceOfNumbers):
    # Write your code here.
    sequenceOfNumbers=list(set(sequenceOfNumbers))
    if (len(sequenceOfNumbers)<2):
        return -1
    for i in range(len(sequenceOfNumbers)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(sequenceOfNumbers)):
            if (sequenceOfNumbers[i]<sequenceOfNumbers[j]):
                temp=sequenceOfNumbers[j]
                sequenceOfNumbers[j]=sequenceOfNumbers[i]
                sequenceOfNumbers[i]=temp
    
    return sequenceOfNumbers[1]

Optimize code:
def findSecondLargest(sequenceOfNumbers):
    # Write your code here.
    sequenceOfNumbers=list(set(sequenceOfNumbers))
    if (len(sequenceOfNumbers)<2):
        return -1
    max_num=sequenceOfNumbers[0]
    second_max=-1
    for i in (sequenceOfNumbers):
        if i>max_num:
            second_max=max_num
            max_num=i
        elif i<max_num and i>second_max:
            second_max=i
        
    return second_max
