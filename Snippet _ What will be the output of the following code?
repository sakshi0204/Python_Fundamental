What will be the output of the following code?

for i in range(0,2,-1):
   print("Hello")

Solution: 

To illustrate this, let's try to break down the sequence generation:

    Start at 0
    Decrement by 1, so the next value would be -1
    But wait, we're supposed to stop before 2, and -1 is already less than 2, so we can't generate any more values.

As a result, the sequence is empty, and the loop doesn't execute.
