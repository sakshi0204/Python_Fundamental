What will be the output of the following code?

i = 0
while i < 5:
    if i == 2:
        continue
    else:
        print(i,end = " ")   
        i += 1
Solution description
In the above code snippet when the value of i will be equal to 2 then we are performing a continue but not incrementing the value of i will be equal to 2 again and again which results in a Runtime Error.
