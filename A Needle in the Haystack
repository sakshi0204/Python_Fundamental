Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 

def find_needle(haystack):
    list1=len(haystack)
    for i in range (0,list1):
        if haystack[i] =='needle':
            return f"found the needle at position {i}"
    # your code here
